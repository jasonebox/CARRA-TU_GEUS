# CARRA-TU_GEUS_AWS
CARRA-TU_GEUS_AWS

work here is about delivering each ~month Greenland hourly AWS data* into an operational weather modeling system under CARRA. Assimilating the AWS data alongside a lot of other observations strongly improves the accuracy of the model.

* emphasis on air pressure and near surface air temperature.
* 
the work includes the use of data from the Envidat API to gather the Koni Steffen GC-Net AWS data that appear at this nice web site https://www.envidat.ch/gcnet/#/

The work reformats data from PROMICE, GEUS GC-Net Koni Steffen GC-Net AWS

state variables, air T, humidity, pressure, wind speed, direction, and instrument location. 

The data have erroneous values I have started rejecting. 

A task should be including my data rejections into the Envidat go-to product that Baptiste and others at GEUS like me are contributing to. It's an effort that argues for good communication between us all.
